# MCP Agent-to-Agent Enterprise Workflow Automation (FINTECH)

Research-grade MCP multi-agent orchestration with:
- Tool contracts (schemas + invariants + idempotency)
- Observability (traces/metrics/logs)
- Evaluation harness + ablation studies
- Reliability controls (budgets, circuit breakers, retries)

SLOs:
- Latency: p95 <= 12s per workflow
- Cost: <= $0.08 per successful workflow
- Policy: FINTECH_DEFAULT (PII redaction enforced)
